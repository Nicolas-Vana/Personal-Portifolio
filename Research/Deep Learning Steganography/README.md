This is an ongoing research project supervised by Dr. Amal Khalifa on the topic of applying deep learning to the field of steganography. Because of this, most of the code provided is still very rough and will be improved for publication. Research project started in January 2022 and is expected to be finished by late 2022.

Development so far is mostly based on the following publication: http://www.esprockets.com/papers/nips2017.pdf

Here all the code is in python and some of my experience using TensorFlow is highlighted. Because the linked publication used TensorFlow 1, we had to redo the code from scratch for it to work on TensorFlow 2.

The dataset used can be obtained from https://www.image-net.org/.
