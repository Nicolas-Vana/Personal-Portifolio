This is an ongoing research project supervised by Dr. Amal Khalifa on the topic of applying deep learning to the field of steganography. Because of this, most of the code provided is not the final work because of privacy reasons. Research project started in January 2022 and is expected to be finished by late 2022.

Development is mostly based on the following publication: http://www.esprockets.com/papers/nips2017.pdf and further exploration will be done to improve the results obtained.

Some of my experience using TensorFlow is highlighted here.

The dataset used can be obtained from https://www.image-net.org/.
