This is an ongoing research on the topic of Ephaptic Coupling, because of this, most of the code provided is still very rough and will be improved for publication. Expected to be finished by July 2022.

Here you will find mostly HOC (High Order Calculator) language code for the biophysical model in NEURON and python code for the analysis of results, plotting, statistics and other supplimentary code.

Some of the code provided under model codes is not mine and is due to https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2016.00065, but since those are also required to run the models, they will be left available.
