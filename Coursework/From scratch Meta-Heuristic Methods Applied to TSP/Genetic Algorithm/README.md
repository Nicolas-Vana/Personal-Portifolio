Using Genetic Algorithms to solve the travelling salesman problem. On this approach, a probability based selection is applied, as well as elitism is used to select the best individuals from each generation.

As expected, we see strict improvement in the solution across generations because of elitism. We also see great improvement in the solution from the starting random population, with a reduction in total distance of about 30%.
